        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I’m Akpakwu John, a passionate and detail-oriented web developer dedicated to building clean, functional, and visually
            appealing digital solutions. My journey into development began with a love for creating projects that solve real
            problems, and over time I’ve grown my skills into building both small- and large-scale web applications.
            I specialize in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, crafting responsive websites that don’t just look
            good but also perform smoothly across all devices. I’ve worked on projects like a supermarket inventory management
            system, a restaurant website, and a sports news platform, each giving me valuable hands-on experience in tackling
            different business needs.
            Beyond web development, I also have skills in graphics design, which allows me to add an extra creative touch to my
            projects, ensuring that the user interface is not only functional but also visually captivating. I also have a
            foundation in mobile app development, which means I understand how to extend solutions beyond the browser when needed.
            What drives me is the excitement of turning ideas into reality, from brainstorming with clients, to writing clean code,
            to finally seeing a project come alive. Whether it’s helping businesses go digital, improving user experience, or
            creating something entirely new, I always bring my best effort, creativity, and problem-solving mindset to the table.
            If you’re looking for someone who’s committed to delivering high-quality work, pays attention to detail, and
            communicates clearly, I’d love to collaborate with you on your next project.
